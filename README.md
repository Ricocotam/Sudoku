# Sudoku solver and generator
This is an  implementation of Sudoku solver. The project represents the sudoku grid with binaries (look in the code to know how, translation incomming) and binary operations to solve it until we have to use backtracking.
The Sudoku generator uses random rotation of a given grid and removing some numbers to fit the difficulty.
